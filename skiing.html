          <p>This trip is for those that are willing to WORK like CRAZY to get the best line on the slope, if you like eating lunch in the lodge when you ski, i’m sorry but this just isn’t for you. This is a straight clif bar on-the-go type weekend.
            <br><br>Now let’s get sendy.
            <br><br>
            Squaw Valley & Alpine Meadows are home to some of the best skiing in the world, the Tahoe terrain and late February snow are like no other. A favorite move by the locals is to spend the night in their car or camper in the parking lot to make sure you get first tracks in the morning… the locals have this right btw. On an average powder day, you want to go to Alpine (there’ll be less crowds and the good stuff doesn't get skied out as much), but if it dumps, get your ass to Squaw.

            C.S.F.R.C’S Favorite Alpine Day: Make your way up Summit Chair and just go straight back, you're trying to get to Grouse Rock. The trek there, if untracked, takes a while. You will need to carry your skis, pass them to your partner, get on your hands and knees, and remember not to ski out of bounds. Once you get to the rock, you’ll know, stop and have your snack and enjoy one of Tahoe’s top views. Then get your skis on and have fun in some knee deep powder. You’ll end up by the Sherwood chair and from there you can take a few chill double-blacks down to get to Scot Chair. Once at Scot Chair, the chute that seldom slides is typically less skied out than Scot Chute and more protected from the wind. Spend some time on Scot Chair for a while and then take ABC up and ski the promised lands. And that's your day at Alpine, your welcome.

            C.S.F.R.C’S Favorite Squaw Day: KT-22 is iconic and has some fucking amazing skiing, but our staff prefers Granite Cheif a bit more, so that’s why we recommend you start the day on the first gondola (though you can’t go wrong with some runs on nose chute or the fingers on the lower mountain). After making your way back to Granite you can have a ton of fun skiing chair line. Pixie cliffs, dropping any of the 5-20’ cliffs, and of course making the short hike up Granite Chief Peak. There also tons of room to make a nice backcountry kicker (or find one in progress) when coming down the skier's left side of the lift. At Squaw you really can’t go wrong, but we just love getting crazy off Granite Chief on a deep day.
