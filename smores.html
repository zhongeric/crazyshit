              You’re camping on top of a cliff, it’s a beautiful 65 degrees out, you have an unobstructed view of the moon and stars, and the only sound you hear besides the crackling fire is you and your friends having a great time… oh and don’t forget the s’mores. This trip is a perfect mix of backpacking, swimming, and sightseeing, for this cheap trip, we’re going to the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore.

              Prep: Although this is a relatively easy backpacking trip, you still need to be prepared or else you are being unreasonably crazy and we can not encourage doing stupid shit like that.
            </p>
            <ul class="white">
              <li>The first step is finding a few friends (1-4) to do the trip with. It is best if these friends are also into doing C.S.F.R.C trips! </li>
              <li>Get a few days off from work, you’ll be backpacking for 4 days and 3 nights, so it’s a little more than a weekend excursion!</li>
              <li>
                Get exercising, although you won’t be walking more than 20miles a day and your pack will stay relatively light, you should make sure that you are capable of doing this.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure that you and your friends have the necessary equipment for backpacking:
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/backpacking-checklist.html"></a></li>
                  <li>You can rent a lot of this gear from REI too (especially the tent!)</li>
                  <li>You also will need weed.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Read this and adjust it to you pace: <a href="https://blackwoodspress.com/blog/20401/how-to-hike-15-to-30-miles-a-day/"></a>
              </li>
              <li>
                Get familiar with this itinerary!
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If using two cars (recommended) drop off one car at the Munising Falls Visitor Center then all get into the other car with your shtuff.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Drop off a second car at the Grand Sable Visitor Center (early in the am!)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Site 1 and distance: Seven Mile Beach (14.4miles) or Benchmark (13.1miles) - (whichever is available)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Site 2: Beaver Creek (6-7 miles)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Site 3: Cliffs (17.5miles) - no water at site
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Exit: Munising Falls Visitor Center (5miles)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Reserving Your Campsites:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Make your reservation for the campsites here
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It’ll cost $5 a person per night plus a $15 reservation fee (so with 4 people the trip is just $18.75 not including food)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Getting your food:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Get S’more stuff! Graham Crackers and chocolate are hard to keep intact while backpacking so either pack it and use on your first night, or just bring the marshmallows!
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Pro tip for preventing the marshmallows from sticking: Leave them out exposed to the air for a day or two before your trip so they get slightly stale, then put them into a ziplock bag for the trip!</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>
                    You're gonna want oatmeal for breakfast, it’s filling and easy to make with some boiling water.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    These <a href="https://www.rei.com/search?q=food">dried food dishes</a> from REI are BANGIN too
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you're feeling fancy, you can get some <a href="https://www.rei.com/search?q=food">shake-n-pour pancake mix</a> for just $2 and some Velveeta Shells!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    And the C.S.F.R.C Certified trail-mix
                    <ul>
                      <li>Peanuts, Dried Cherries, Plain M&Ms, Pretzel M&Ms, Gluten Free Pretzel Sticks, Cashews</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Extra Things to Pack:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You are gonna want to treat every piece of clothing and shelter with deet before you embark on the trip. The deet will last for a long time and really help you with the bugs
C.S.F.R.C did this and got ZERO bug bites on their trip
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you are gonna go swimming, you definitely need a swimsuit, but you also need one of these bad boys. Trust me, Chamois dry super well and are tiny as fuck for you pack.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You also need a Hacky Sack so you can play the iconic C.S.F.R.C Backpacking game, PELT. If you don’t know how to play, look it up (though it’s hard to find instructions)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

The joy of backpacking is discovering the land and trails while you are there, so I won’t give any thing more away. But remember, study your map and trails, always be prepared on water (especially for the Cliffs campsite), and never try to take a “shortcut” off-trail.
