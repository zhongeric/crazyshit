              On this trip, not only are we going 100ft underwater, but we’re going to need to bring our game faces.  For this trip, you need Advanced Scuba Certification with optional certs in Wreck diving and Nitrox use, and preferably, some poker experience.

              There are a couple of things to know about this dive- first, its a 110 foot boat from the late 1800s.  So probably be careful.  Secondly, it's a felony to damage a wreck.  So definitely be careful. Before you jump right in, there is one thing you need to do first: weigh down some cards, because we’re playing underwater poker.  To do this, grab any normal 52 card deck and tape a quarter to the back of each card.  If you want to use them more than once, I’d recommend buying <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waterproof-Playing-Cards-Scuba-divers/dp/B001O7A9YU">these</a>.  Before you go, be sure to bring a dive knife and flashlight, it is a wreck after all.

              Hop in the water, find a safe place near or in the wreck (make sure the ground is below you- not ship), deflate your BCD, and start playing.  It may be better to make some poker hand signals with your friends before jumping in.
